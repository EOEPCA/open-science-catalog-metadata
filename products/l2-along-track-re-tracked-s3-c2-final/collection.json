    "description": "The HYDROCOASTAL final product is produced using innovative retracking algorithms for the  coastal zone (UBonn Statistical STARS type) and inland waters (DTU - Multiple Waveform  Persistent Peak -MWaPP), selected as the best performing algorithms tested earlier in the  project. The product is provided at 3 levels (L2, L3, L4) L2 - Level 2 Extended Product is along track L2 product – for all regions in Table 1, except 15 (Alps). See https://avl-repo.earthconsole.eu/sarvatore/Hydrocoastal/HYDROCOASTAL_Final_Product_Readme.pdf. Final Product L2E (Level 2 Extended Format). Folder structure: All final L2E product data are under the top-level folders “s3_full” (Sentinel 3A and 3B data),  and “cs2_full” (Cryosat-2 SAR mode data). Under these top-level folders are zip files  containing all the data for each region. L2 data are provided in HYDROCOASTAL L2E format. See the HYDROCOASTAL Product. Specification Document at: https://www.satoc.eu/projects/hydrocoastal/docs.html. Data format and content: For regions which include coastal / estuary parts, both DTU and U Bonn re-trackers have been  implemented. Where they have provided a valid solution, L2 output from both re-trackers are included in the merged final product, together with the operational ESA L2 solution (resp. L2  LAND for S3 mission and L2 ICE Baseline D for CryoSat-2 mission; L2 WAT for South Australia),  interpolated on to the HYDROCOASTAL along-track locations. For regions only over inland water, only the DTU re-tracker has been applied. For these  regions the L2E merged product includes the DTU and operational ESA L2 output.",
