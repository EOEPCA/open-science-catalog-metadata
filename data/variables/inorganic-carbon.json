  "description": "The ocean is a major component of the global carbon cycle, absorbing enormous quantities of carbon in natural cycles driven by the ocean circulation, biogeochemistry and biology. Since seawater has very high capacity for absorbing carbon, the ocean has an inhibitory effect on the atmospheric accumulation of carbon dioxide and related greenhouse effect. The net ocean carbon uptake depends significantly on chemical and biological activity, and therefore it varies due to changing oceanic conditions and ecosystem composition. The chemical pathways of the inorganic carbon in the ocean mean that this uptake causes a decline in ocean pH, also known as ocean acidification. https://gcos.wmo.int/en/essential-climate-variables/inorganic-carbon",
