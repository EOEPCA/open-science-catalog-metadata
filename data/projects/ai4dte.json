      "description": "The project analyses the potential of artificial intelligence technologies for a digital twin of the earth and determine a roadmap for further developments. digital twin of the earth will allow science and policy users alike to gain insights of our earth system and will help with decision support.There are two key user groups of a digital twin of the earth: Scientific users will benefit from the data access and modelling capabilities that a digital twin of the earth provides Policy users will benefit from explanations and post-processed data that is accessible also to non-expert users. A digital twin of the earth shall allow access to a diverse set of data sources of our planet and the results of different kinds of models. These outputs shall be available on different detail levels, such that they can be used by both scientific users as well as policy users. The team focuses on identifying AI technologies that a digital twin of the earth can benefit from. We will both identify existing capabilities that are already available and will point out potential for further developments.",
