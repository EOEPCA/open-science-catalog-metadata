  "description": "Marine coastal regions are amongst the most productive systems of the planet, yet they are undergoing rapid transformations in response to intensifying human activities and global change. Regime shifts, abrupt transitions between alternative states, are increasingly observed in a wide range of coastal systems, including coral reefs, macroalgal forests, seagrasses and mangroves. These non-linear responses to deteriorating environmental conditions often result in considerable loss of ecosystem functions and services. https://gcos.wmo.int/en/essential-climate-variables/marine-habitats",
