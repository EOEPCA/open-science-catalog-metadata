Melt processes have a significant impact on the surface energy budget in snow-covered areas, as wet snow has a relatively low albedo in the visible and near-infrared spectrum. Moreover, enhanced surface meltwater production has an impact on glacier motion by increasing the internal water pressure. Passive and active microwave data acquired by satellite sensors are the main data sources for products on monitoring melt extent over the ice sheets. Passive microwave data has  been widely used to map and monitor melt zones over the Greenland Ice Sheet. 4DGreenland aims at producing a consistent climate data record on the presence of liquid water and snow properties over Greenland for studying surface melt processes, along with developing methods for homogenizing melt extent products from different sensors.","https://4dgreenland.eo4cryo.dk/?page_id=48",,,,Sea-ice elevation,,,"Greenland","[[[-73.709433726,60.2878324851],[-12.713339976,60.2878324851],[-12.713339976,83.5902211563],[-73.709433726,83.5902211563],[-73.709433726,60.2878324851]]]",,"Cryosphere",,,,,,"Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2"

This are the outputs from a full marine carbonate system analysis, calculated from machine learning estimates of total alkalinity (TA) and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2). The surface-ocean pCO2 presented here is the ensemble mean of 16 two-step clustering-regression machine learning estimates. The ensemble is a combination of eight clustering instances and two regression methods. For the clustering, we use K-means clustering (21 clusters) repeated with different initiations, resulting in slightly different clusters. Two machine learning regression methods are applied to each of these clustering instances. These machine learning methods are feed-forward neural-network (FFNN), and gradient boosted machine using decision trees (GBDT). The average of the ensemble members is used as the final estimate. Further, the standard deviation of the ensemble members is an analog of the uncertainty. Total alkalinity and pCO2 are then used to solve for the remaining parameters of the marine carbonate system using the PyCO2SYS software (to derive pH and total dissolved inorganic carbon, or DIC). The temperature and salinity products used in this calculation are provided in the file. Phosphate and silicate from the interpolated World Ocean Atlas (2018) product were used. The total scale for pH was used. The product extends from the start of 1985 to the end of 2020.

The occurrence of a sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) can be identified as a rapid increase in the polar temperature (>25 K in a week or less), the reversal of the meridional temperature gradient (T at 90˚N minus T at 60˚N) from negative to positive values, and the reduction or reversal of the zonal mean zonal wind in the stratosphere at 60˚N. An SSW event is called ""major"" when the direction of the zonal mean zonal wind at 60˚N and 10 hPa changes from eastward to westward; otherwise the event is called ""minor"". The ionospheric variability results not only from SSWs but also from solar and magnetospheric sources. The F10.7 index is a proxy for the solar energetic radiation flux into the Earth's upper atmosphere. The Kp index quantifies geomagnetic activity, which is closely related to the activity level of the magnetosphere. Geomagnetic activity is considered to be high when the daily sum of the Kp index is 23 or more.","https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/section/geomagnetism/projects/archive/vera-vertical-coupling-in-earths-atmosphere-at-mid-and-high-latitudes/#c65013",,,,"Geomagnetic field","2008.01.01","2018.12.31",,,"2021.04.01","Magnetosphere_Ionosphere",,,,,,"SWARM"
