  "name": "Snow",
  "description": "Snow refers to forms of ice crystals that precipitate from the atmosphere (usually from clouds) and undergo changes on the Earth's surface. Snow cover on the ground plays a significant role in the climate system due to its high albedo, heat insulation and contribution to soil moisture and runoff, thus an important variable in monitoring climate change. https://gcos.wmo.int/en/essential-climate-variables/snow",
