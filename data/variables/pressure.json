{"name":"Pressure","description":"Surface pressure is a fundamental meteorological variable controlling weather systems and providing information on the intensity of weather systems, including tropical cyclones. Pressure observations are required for the long-term simulations of past weather and climate known as \"reanalyses\". Patterns of large-scale pressure variation are used to construct circulation indices that are closely linked to known variations in global and regional climate. https://gcos.wmo.int/en/essential-climate-variables/pressure","theme":"Atmosphere","parentVariables":[],"parentProject":[],"startDate":"","endDate":"","satelliteMissions":[],"eo4societyURL":"","link":"https://eo4society.esa.int/communities/scientists/esa-atmosphere-science-cluster/"}
