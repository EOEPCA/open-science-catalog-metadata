  "description": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an important climate-relevant trace gas in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. In the troposphere it acts as a strong greenhouse gas and in the stratosphere it acts as an ozone depleting substance because it is the precursor of ozone depleting nitric oxide radicals. The ocean - including its coastal areas such as continental shelves, estuaries and upwelling areas - contribute about 30% to the atmospheric N2O budget. https://gcos.wmo.int/en/essential-climate-variables/n2o",
