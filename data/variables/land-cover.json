  "description": "Land cover is the observed (bio)-physical cover on the Earth\u2019s surface. It influences climate by modifying water and energy exchanges with the atmosphere and by changing greenhouse gas and aerosol sources and sinks. Land-cover conditions are inherently dynamic (i.e. seasonality) and distributions are linked to regional climatic conditions, so changes in cover can be due to climate change on a regional scale as well as directly due to human activities. https://gcos.wmo.int/en/essential-climate-variables/land-cover",
